# The Kashti Developer Guide

This guide explains how to work on the Kashti codebase.

## Clone Repo and Build Dependencies

Begin by cloning this repository with your favorite Git tool.

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:Azure/kashti.git
$ cd kashti
```

Install dependancies and run the app with these commands. 

```console
$ yarn                              # install project dependencies
$ ng serve                          # start a local server in development mode
$ ng serve --environment prod       # start a local server in production mode (minification, uglification, etc.)
$ ng lint                           # run linters 
$ ng test                           # run unit tests
$ ng e2e                            # run e2e tests in Chrome
```

### Deployment

Kashti can be run locally via a `ng serve`.

To install in a Kubernetes development cluster, we recommend using the chart.

If you are running Minikube, you can do a full build of this repo into a Docker
image:

```console
$ eval $(minikube docker-env)
$ yarn docker-build
$ helm install -n brigade-ui chart/kashti --set brigade.apiServer=http://localhost:7745
```

This will push a copy of the Docker image into your Minikube docker registry and
then install the chart.

The value of `brigade.apiServer` should be the fully qualified URL to your Brigade
installation's API server. This is the URL that the _client_ will see, so you
may need to use the outside IP address, not the cluster IP.

The example above can be used along with a few `kubectl port-forward` commands to
locally access your Kashti UI. See the [Install Guide](install.md) for more.
